A custom trained Yolov11 model to Detect Pallets which can be used with ROS2

This model can be used in realtime camera or in a Simulation and can be run as a ROS Node which subscribes to a camera topic and detects Pallets.

## Dataset
The Dataset is formed in the COCO Dataset format as YOLO models are pre trained on the COCO Dataset.

The code for creating the Dataset can be found in [Dataset Creation](Dataset_code)
